# WhatsApp Group Chat Analysis

## Overview
This is a WhatsApp Group Chat Analysis project, developed as a personal project for data analysis and insights extraction from WhatsApp group conversations. The project allows users to upload a group chat file exported from WhatsApp and analyze interactions and trends within the group.

## Description
This simple yet powerful project enables you to gain insights into the communication patterns of a WhatsApp group. Upon uploading the group chat file, the tool provides both overall group analysis and individual user analysis. By clicking the "Show Analysis" button, users can access detailed metrics and visualizations, including:

1. **Top Statistics**: An overview displaying the total number of messages sent, total words used, total media shared, and total links shared in the group chat.
2. **Monthly Timeline**: A graphical representation of message frequency on a monthly basis, showing how activity changes over time.
3. **Daily Timeline**: An analysis of daily messaging activity to track trends and observe any periodic spikes.
4. **Activity Map**: Highlights the most active days and months in the group, showcasing peak engagement periods.
5. **Weekly Activity Map**: Displays weekly patterns in messaging to identify which days of the week are the busiest.
6. **Most Busy Users**: Identifies the most active users in the group, providing a leaderboard based on message count.
7. **Wordcloud**: A visualization of the most common words used, providing a snapshot of prevalent topics and language patterns.
8. **Most Common Words Used**: A detailed breakdown of frequently used words, allowing for further insights into group topics and vocabulary.
9. **Emoji Analysis**: Examines emoji usage within the group, showing which emojis are most popular among users.

This project can be particularly useful for community managers, group admins, or anyone interested in understanding group dynamics within WhatsApp.
